Requirements achieved:

- Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
- Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either Responsive Design or media queries.
- Create a working GET API route in your server.
- Create a working POST API route in your client.
- Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.
- Provide additional functionality on the form, for example, by adding form validation or other options.
- Got the review section to update after a new review is submitted so the user can see their review

Reflections:

- I've been surprised how much I've enjoyed creating the server side this week - I had always assumed I'd prefer front-end development over backend. I also felt much more confident in creating the logic as we had covered this on Thursday.
- The only problem I had from a backend pov was after deploying my client and server on Render. I noticed my datbase info wasn't showing on client end. I used the Network tab and quickly realised there was an extra "/" in my server URL within my main.js file. I fixed the typo and that solved the 404 error.
- What I really struggled with this week was layout and styling. I had a clear vision drawn up in a wireframe, but I really struggled to execute it and as a result I'm quite disappointed with my UI design. I attempted to create a cosy theme with autumnal colours. I didn't feel a background image was right as it detracted from the content but because of that the webpage feels very basic - perhaps a gradient would've helped.

Requests:

- I'd really like some additional help with understanding flexbox and grid. I get the basics, but really struggle to apply it to real-world examples, especially wwith multiple elements and combining different layouts. I've revisited the suggested learning materials and watched some additional video tutorials to help with assignments, but I feel like I've got a mental block with it now so some extra help would be really appreciated if possible.
